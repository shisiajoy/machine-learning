# Startup Success/Failure Prediction 

-This project analyzes factors influencing the success or failure of startups. Using machine learning algorithms, it aims to build a predictive model that can distinguish successful startups from unsuccessful ones based on various features.

## Project Structure

1. startup data.csv
   
Contains the dataset with features such as funding amount, team size, industry sector, location, and other attributes related to startup performance.

2. start_up_success_fail_prediction.ipynb
   
Jupyter notebook with data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation. It walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and training multiple models to predict startup success.

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to use historical data to identify patterns and key factors that differentiate successful startups from unsuccessful ones. This can guide investors and entrepreneurs in making data-driven decisions.
